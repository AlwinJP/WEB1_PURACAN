	<h1 style="color: RED;">No Time to Pray</h1>
	<h2>By K.J. Koshy</h2>

	<p style="font-size: 2%">I knelt to pray but not for long, <br>
		I had too much to do. <br>
		I had to hurry and get to work <br>
		For bills would soon be due. 

		<br><br>

		So I knelt and said a hurried prayer,<br> 
		And jumped up off my knees. <br>
		My Christian duty was now done <br>
		My soul could rest at ease.

		<br><br>

		All day long I had no time <br>
		To spread a word of cheer. <br>
		No time to speak of Christ to friends,<br> 
		They’d laugh at me I’d fear.

		<br><br>

		No time, no time, too much to do,<br> 
		That was my constant cry, <br>
		No time to give to souls in need<br> 
		But at last the time, the time to die.

		<br><br>

		I went before the Lord, <br>
		I came, I stood with downcast eyes.<br> 
		For in his hands God held a book; <br>
		It was the book of life.

		<br><br>

		God looked into his book and said <br>
		“Your name I cannot find. <br>
		I once was going to write it down... <br>
		But never found the time.”</p>
